                            Why Go For Self-Publishing?

                            Self-publishing offers authors greater control and flexibility. It avoids delays with agents and publishers, and is ideal for targeting niche markets or releasing books quickly to capitalise on timely opportunities. Print-on-demand options suit new authors, while making it easy to republish for accuracy or new editions.                        </p>
                        <p className="paragraph">
                            Unlike traditional publishing, self-publishing allows you to retain all rights, control every aspect of your book, and keep a higher royalty. With the help of an experienced partner, you can also print in small quantities to reduce costs and tailor everything to best suit your audience.                        </p>
